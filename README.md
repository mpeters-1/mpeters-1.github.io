# About me
## My Interests
## Websites I Recommend
[_Places to Read_](https://www.placestoread.xyz) - A site that has a collected list of places people like to read from all over the world. Fun to use when you find yourself in a new place!  
[_Couchers.org_](https://couchers.org/) - A fun couch-surfing website for travellers. Love this more casual style of traveling and find it pretty cool that it's volunteer-run!
