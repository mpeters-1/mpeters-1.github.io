# About me
## My Interests
I have a pretty broad range of interests but I feel like with each year of adulthood they seem to be growing bigger and bigger. I think though for the current moment, my goals seem to be one of my biggest interests (if that even counts)! I think for me, outside of those as my major interests I'm really getting into doing more things outdoors (kayaking, camping, hiking, and even horseback riding) that I didn't have the chance to do when I was a kid, and learning cool, random things like picking up a pilot's license or at least taking a flying lesson. Definitely not things I thought I would be doing when I was younger but I'm so glad that growing older has found me opening my mind more! 
## Websites I Recommend
[_Places to Read_](https://www.placestoread.xyz) - A site that has a collected list of places people like to read from all over the world. Fun to use when you find yourself in a new place!  
[_Couchers.org_](https://couchers.org/) - A couch-surfing website for travellers. Love this more casual style of traveling and find it pretty cool that it's volunteer-run!
