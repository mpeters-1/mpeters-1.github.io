# About me
## My Interests
I've always felt like I have a pretty broad range of interests but I feel like with each year of adulthood they seem to be growing bigger and bigger. I think though for the current moment, my goals seem to be one of my biggest interests (if that even counts)! I'm really focused on what I'm pursuing and right now that seems to be one of my greatest priorities. Outside of that, I am pursuing more things like getting into new activities outdoors (kayaking, camping, hiking, and even horseback riding) and trying things that I didn't have the chance to do as a kid. I'm also trying cool, random things like taking a flying lesson. Definitely not things I thought I would be doing when I was younger but I'm so glad that growing older has found me opening my mind more! 
## Websites I Recommend
[_Places to Read_](https://www.placestoread.xyz) - A site that has a collected list of places people like to read from all over the world. Fun to use when you find yourself in a new place!  
[_Couchers.org_](https://couchers.org/) - A couch-surfing website for travellers. Love this more casual style of traveling and find it pretty cool that it's volunteer-run!
